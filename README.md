# Nami ðŸŒŠ 

## **Welcome!**
This is my first project in the Web3 space, inspired by [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/p/build-solidity-web3-app)

## **Frontend**
The frontend was written in React and deployed on Vercel. You can check out the deployed site [here](https://nami-prod.vercel.app/).

## **Backend**
The backend was written in Solidity and I used [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) as my environment. I used [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/) to deploy my contract to the Goerli testnet. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/ArKane-6418/Nami).

## **Future Plans**
- [ ] Modify the CSS futher to make the site more presentable and accessible  
- [ ] Indicate whether a user has won fake ETH when they send a wave
- [ ] Add a mining animation whenever the user sends a wave
